The syntax for JMoribus is based on the Gherkin syntax.
Therefore it knows the keywords `Given`, `When`, `Then` and `And` for steps.
These can be grouped in Scenarios by the keyword `Scenario:` followed by a title.
See the following simple example:

```Gherkin
Feature: MultiScenarioTitle
  In order to realize a named business value
  As a explicit system actor
  I want to gain some beneficial outcome which furthers the goal

#-- This is a comment

Scenario: scenario description
Given a system state
When I do something
Then system is in a different state
And the system is still working fine
```
